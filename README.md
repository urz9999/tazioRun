Outrun Clone done in Plain Javascript and heavely commented for didactic purposes

# Notes
The code is very heavely commented as its purpose is to help familiarize with Javascript and have fun at the same time.
The game can be played locally but sound and effects are blocked. To play with them use the solution with WAMP/XAMPP or on a server online/in a container etc.
